Loading Bars

Wanted to work with some loading options for CSS. Became tired of seeing the same loading bars when visiting a website of some sort. Currently learning more about Animation within CSS. I must admit, CSS is a beast to fight, but once you get your hits in ... it gets easier. LOL. 

Enjoy!
